This class attempts to mimic the exact functionality of the 
python standard library Queue.Queue class, but with a coroutine context:

* the queue calls return coroutine operations

So, to use this you write someting like:

.. sourcecode:: python
    
    @coroutine
    def foo():
        q = cogen.core.queue.Queue()
        yield q.put(123)
        val = yield q.get()
