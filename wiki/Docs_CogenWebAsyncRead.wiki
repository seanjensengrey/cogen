This is actually a hack that mixes ReadAll and ReadLine and 
patches their state attributes. Hopefully i'll evolve it to
something more elegant at some point.

== Methods ==

=== {{{__init__}}} ===
signature: {{{__init__(self, conn, req, len=4096, **kws)}}}

Initial `req` object holds the state of the operations involving
reading the input and it requires to have these attributes:

* read_chunked = 
* content_length = 
* read_count = 0
* state = async.Read.NEED_SIZE

These have to be initialized in the request.

=== {{{run}}} ===
signature: {{{run(self, reactor)}}}
