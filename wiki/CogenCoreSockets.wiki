== Classes ==

=== Accept ===

Returns a (conn, addr) tuple when the operation completes.


=== Connect ===

Connect to the given `addr` using `sock`.


=== Read ===

`len` is max read size, BUT, if if there are buffers from ReadLine 
return them first.
Example usage:

{{{
yield sockets.Read(socket_object, buffer_length)
}}}


=== ReadAll ===

Run this operator till we've read `len` bytes.


=== ReadLine ===

Run this operator till we read a newline (\n) or we have a overflow.

`len` is the max size for a line


=== SendFile ===

Uses underling OS sendfile call or a regular memory copy operation if 
there is no sendfile.
You can use this as a WriteAll if you specify the length.
Usage:
    
{{{
yield sockets.SendFile(, , 0) 
    # will send till send operations return 0
    
yield sockets.SendFile(, , 0, blocksize=0)
    # there will be only one send operation (if successfull)
    # that meas the whole file will be read in memory if there is 
    #no sendfile
    
yield sockets.SendFile(, , 0, )
    # this will hang if we can'self read  bytes 
    #from the file
}}}


=== Socket ===




=== Write ===

Write the buffer to the socket and return the number of bytes written.


=== WriteAll ===

Run this operation till all the bytes have been written.
