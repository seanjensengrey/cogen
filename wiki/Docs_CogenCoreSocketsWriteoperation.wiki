All the socket operations have these generic properties that the 
poller and scheduler interprets:

  * timeout - the ammout of time in seconds or timedelta, or the datetime 
  value till the poller should wait for this operation.
  * weak_timeout - if this is True the timeout handling code will take 
  into account the time of last activity (that would be the time of last
  `try_run` call)
  * prio - a flag for the scheduler

=== {{{try_run}}} ===
signature: {{{try_run(self, reactor)}}}

This method will return a None value or raise a exception if the 
operation can't complete at this time.

The socket poller will run this method if the socket is 
readable/writeable.

If this returns a value that evaluates to False, the poller will try to
run this at a later time (when the socket is readable/writeable again).
