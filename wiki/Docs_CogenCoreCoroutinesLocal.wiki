= Class: `local` =

A threadlocal-like object that works in the context of coroutines.
That means, the current running coroutine has the _ident_.

Coroutine.run_op sets the indent before running a step and unsets after.

Example:
{{{
loc = local() 
loc.foo = 1
}}}
The *loc* instance's values will be different for separate coroutines.
