= Class: `Operation` =

All operations derive from this. This base class handles 
the priority flag. 

Eg:

{{{
yield Operation(prio=priority.DEFAULT)
}}}        

  * prio - a priority constant, where the coro is appended on the active 
    coroutine queue and how the coroutine is runned depend on this.

If you need something that can't be done in a coroutine fashion you 
probabily need to subclass this and make a custom operation for your
issue.

Note: you don't really use this, this is for subclassing for other operations.

== Methods ==

=== {{{finalize}}} ===
signature: {{{finalize(self)}}}

Called just before the Coroutine wrapper passes the operation back
in the generator. Return value is the value actualy sent in the 
generator.

=== {{{process}}} ===
signature: {{{process(self, sched, coro)}}}

This is called when the operation is to be processed by the 
scheduler. Code here works modifies the scheduler and it's usualy 
very crafty.


== Attributes ==

=== {{{prio}}} ===

{{{<member 'prio' of 'Operation' objects>}}}
