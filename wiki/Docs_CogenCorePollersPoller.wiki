= Class: Poller =

A poller just checks if there are ready-sockets for the operations.
The operations are not done here, they are done in the socket ops instances.

== Methods ==

=== {{{__init__}}} ===
signature: {{{__init__(self, scheduler)}}}



=== {{{__len__}}} ===
signature: {{{__len__(self)}}}

Returns number of waiting operations registered in the poller.

=== {{{add}}} ===
signature: {{{add(self, op, coro)}}}

Implemented by the child class that actualy implements the polling.
Registers an operation.

=== {{{handle_errored}}} ===
signature: {{{handle_errored(self, desc)}}}

Handles descriptors that have errors.

=== {{{remove}}} ===
signature: {{{remove(self, op, coro)}}}

Implemented by the child class that actualy implements the polling.
Removes a operation.

=== {{{run}}} ===
signature: {{{run(self, timeout=0)}}}

Implemented by the child class that actualy implements the polling.
Calls the underlying OS polling mechanism and runs the operations for
any ready descriptor.

=== {{{run_once}}} ===
signature: {{{run_once(self, fdesc, waiting_ops)}}}

Run a operation, remove it from the poller and return the result. 
Called from the main poller loop. 

=== {{{run_operation}}} ===
signature: {{{run_operation(self, op)}}}

Run the socket op and return result or exception. 

=== {{{run_or_add}}} ===
signature: {{{run_or_add(self, op, coro)}}}

Perform operation or add the operation in the poller if socket isn't
ready. Called from the scheduller. 

=== {{{waiting_op}}} ===
signature: {{{waiting_op(self, testcoro)}}}

Returns the registered operation for some specified coroutine.
