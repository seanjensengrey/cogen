=== {{{fail}}} ===
signature: {{{fail(self, msg=None)}}}

Fail immediately, with the given message.

=== {{{failIf}}} ===
signature: {{{failIf(self, expr, msg=None)}}}

Fail the test if the expression is true.

=== {{{failIf}}} ===
signature: {{{failIf(self, expr, msg=None)}}}

Fail the test if the expression is true.

=== {{{failIfAlmostEqual}}} ===
signature: {{{failIfAlmostEqual(self, first, second, places=7, msg=None)}}}

Fail if the two objects are equal as determined by their
difference rounded to the given number of decimal places
(default 7) and comparing to zero.

Note that decimal places (from zero) are usually not the same
as significant digits (measured from the most signficant digit).

=== {{{failUnlessRaises}}} ===
signature: {{{failUnlessRaises(self, excClass, callableObj, *args, **kwargs)}}}

Fail unless an exception of class excClass is thrown
by callableObj when invoked with arguments args and keyword
arguments kwargs. If a different type of exception is
thrown, it will not be caught, and the test case will be
deemed to have suffered an error, exactly as for an
unexpected exception.
