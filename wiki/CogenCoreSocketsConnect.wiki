= Class: Connect =

Connect to the given `addr` using `sock`.

== Methods ==

=== __init__ ===
signature: __init__(self, sock, addr, **kws)



=== run ===
signature: run(self)

We need to avoid some non-blocking socket connect quirks: 
  - if you attempt a connect in NB mode you will always 
  get EWOULDBLOCK, presuming the addr is correct.
