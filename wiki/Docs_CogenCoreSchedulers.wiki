= Module: `schedulers` =
Scheduling framework.

The scheduler handles the timeouts, run the operations and does very basic 
management of coroutines. Most of the heavy logic is in each operation class.
See: [Docs_CogenCoreEvents events] and [Docs_CogenCoreSockets sockets]
Most of those operations work with attributes we set in the scheduler.

== Classes ==

=== [Docs_CogenCoreSchedulersScheduler Scheduler] ===
Basic deque-based scheduler with timeout support and primitive 
prioritisaiton parameters.

Usage:
{{{Scheduler(reactor=DefaultReactor, default_priority=priority.LAST, default_timeout=None)}}}

  * reactor: a reactor class to use
  * default_priority: a default priority option for operations that do not 
  set it. check [Docs_CogenCoreUtilPriority priority].
  * default_timeout: a default timedelta or number of seconds to wait for 
  the operation, -1 means no timeout.
